      âš  **Most feature requests will be closed with little or no explanation.**
      
      Fixie's primary feature is that it does not accrete features. The driving design goal is to provide minimal APIs with flexible and idiomatic customization mechanisms *so that adding new features won't even be necessary*. If something feels like a missing feature, the real missing feature may be some broader change to the customization mechanisms.
      
      If the vision for this project makes it insufficient for your needs, we encourage you to reach for an alternative framework with a larger scope.
